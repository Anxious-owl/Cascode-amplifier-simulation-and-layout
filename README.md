**Design and Simulation of Analog Circuits in 180nm and 22nm Technology**

* Designed and simulated Beta Multiplier, Cascode Current Mirror, and Cascode Amplifier circuits in LTSpice for 180nm and 22nm nodes.
* Achieved optimized circuit performance by adjusting MOSFET W/L ratios and bias voltages.
* Analyzed key metrics like gain (26.02 dB), unity gain bandwidth, and power consumption (as low as 27.2 ÂµW for 22nm).
* Developed Magic VLSI layouts for the 180nm Cascode Current Mirror and Amplifier, ensuring design compactness and scalability.
* Tested the layout using NGSpice
